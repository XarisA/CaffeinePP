# caffeine++

Caffeine++ is a free, open-source console application written in C++ that can prevent the system from entering the power-saving mode.
Basically, it prevents the screen from turning off and your computer from going to sleep.
This application was developed as a command-line alternative to Linux caffeine on Windows.

## Command Line Arguments

Caffeine++ supports command-line arguments with the following options:

```text
arguments:
  -m,       -start-minimised       start with the window minimized
  -t time,  -timer                 runs for a specific time in seconds
  -i,       -hide-console          hide cmd
  -k,       -simulate-keypress     Simulate key process in the console
```

- Hide console can be used if you want to "start the program as a service" by placing a shortcut in the startup folder in Windows.
- Simulate keypress is an option used simply as graphic animation and nothing more

### Examples

#### Run the app for an hour

```cmd
> caffeine++.exe -t 3600
```

#### Run the app for an hour and hide the command window

```cmd
> caffeine++.exe -t 3600 -i
```

#### Run the app infinitely and Simulate keypress

```cmd
> caffeine++.exe -k
```

## Command Line Arguments in Shortcut

The command line arguments can be used in the command prompt but also as parameters in the shortcut.

### Examples

- create a shortcut pointing to the executable file
- open the shortcutâ€™s Properties window
- in the shortcut tab, add your parameters to the target field
